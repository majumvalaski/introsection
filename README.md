# Intro Section with dropdown menu


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is one more challenge from Frontend Mentor
## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out an intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Learns  
By working on this project I could practice HTML, CSS and learn how to do a dropdown using JavaScript. By going through the tasks of the challenge I could understand even more about CSS.

## Access

To have access to the intro section page there is no need to download any software or anything.

## Bugs

There is one bugs that I was not able to solve in time:
- The Features menu doesn't disappear when the user clicks outside of the menu as it does with the company's menu. It only disappears when the user clicks again at the features button.
